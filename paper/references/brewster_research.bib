We derive the Fresnel coefficients of the system and the Poynting vectors at the interface, in order to compute the reflectance and transmittance of the system. We use a particular parametrisation of the referred Fresnel coefficients so as to make a connection with the ones obtained for refraction by an interface between two lossless media. This analysis allows the discussion of an actual application, namely the Fresnel polarisation of infra-red radiation by elemental bismuth, based on the concept of pseudo Brewster's angle.},

The author begins by presenting the relevant basic principles such as radiation and scattering, wave propagation, diffraction, and coherence. He then goes on to examine a broad range of phenomena and applications. The topics covered include spectromicroscopy, EUV astronomy, synchrotron radiation, and soft X-ray lasers. The author also provides a wealth of useful reference material such as electron binding energies, characteristic emission lines and photo-absorption cross-sections. The book will be of great interest to graduate students and researchers in engineering, physics, chemistry, and the life sciences. It will also appeal to practising engineers involved in semiconductor fabrication and materials science.},

  abstract = {Dear Sir, The discovery of the polarisation of light by reflexion, con\-stitutes a memorable epoch in the history of optics; and the name of Malus, who first made known this remarkable pro\-perty of bodies, will be for ever associated with a branch of science which he had the sole merit of creating. By a few brilliant and comprehensive experiments he established the general fact, that light acquired the same property as one of the pencils formed by double refraction, when it was reflected at a particular angle from the surfaces of all transparent bodies: he found that the angle of incidence at which this property was communicated, was greater in bodies of a high refractive power, and he measured, with considerable accuracy, the polarising angles for glass and water. In order to discover the law which regulated the phenomena, he com\-pared these angles with the refractive and dispersive powers of glass and water, and finding that there was no relation be\-tween these properties of transparent bodies, he draws the following general conclusion. ``The polarising angle neither`` follows the order of the refractive powers, nor that of the ``dispersive forces. It is a property of bodies independent`` of the other modes of action which they exercise upon ``light.`` This premature generalisation of a few imperfectly ascer\-tained facts, is perhaps equalled only by the mistake of Sir Isaac Newton, who pronounced the construction of an achromatic telescope to be incompatible with the known principles of optics. Like Newton, too, Malus himself aban\-doned the enquiry; and even his learned associates in the Institute, to whom he bequeathed the prosecution of his views, have sought for fame in the investigation of other properties of polarised light.},

Meanwhile ellipsometry is a well-established method for thin film analysis. It provides material parameters like n and k even for arbitrary anisotropic layers, film thicknesses in the range down to a few \AA ngstr\"om, and ellipsometry is used to analyze the shape of nm-scale surface structures. But, the determination of such manifold information by means of light polarization changing upon reflection at a sample surface requires appropriate optical models. This introductory chapter will provide a general overview and explanation of theoretical and experimental concepts and their limitations. It will introduce the very basic data evaluation steps in a comprehensive manner and will highlight the principal requirements for the characterization of functional organic surfaces and films.},

  abstract = {A novel fully-analog lock-in amplifier for the accurate measurements of low quantities of gas in sensor applications is here presented. When compared with commercial lock-in and other solutions available in the literature, the proposed system implements an automatic alignment of the relative phase between input and reference signals, both at power-on and for any variation of the input signal phase and amplitude during the working time, so allowing to detect, accurately and in a continuous way, the mean value of the input signal coming from sensors (typically buried into noise). The circuit has been optimized to operate at a specified reference frequency, in particular 77 Hz; this value is suitable for gas sensor applications, since it avoids also any kind of interferences at 50 Hz net frequency and its harmonics. Experimental results have confirmed the correct functionality of the system, also tested for both carbon monoxide (CO) and ethylene glycol detections. With respect to the simpler resistive gas sensor interface, implemented by a resistive voltage divider, the improvement experimentally given by the proposed automatic lock-in amplifier, in terms of resolution, has been of a factor of about 100 for the CO and 230 for the ethylene glycol measurements, so allowing a theoretical gas detection in the order of ppb.},

  abstract = {A geometric visualization is presented for the Brewster angle for a plane wave reflecting from an interface. The surface is assumed isotropic but it is allowed to display both dielectric and magnetic susceptibility, and hence the Brewster (polarizing) angle can attain any value between 0 and 90 degrees, and can exist for both parallel and perpendicular polarizations. The geometric construction (a tetrahedron) is spanned by the basic material parameters of the surface. The Brewster angle appears in one of the faces of the tetrahedron.},

  abstract = {A refractometry taking measuring of Brewster angles for birefringent materials is proposed. The technique is based on the angular scanning of the reflected power of p-polarized light and the determination of the two specific minimums at the Brewster angles for the two orthogonal orientations of the optical axis of the material. In these configurations, the testing light does not experience the birefringent in the material, assuming the state of ordinary or extraordinary rays alternately to orientation of the optical axis. The origin and influence on the measurement of the nonzero residual power at Brewster angle are accentuated.},

  abstract = {In the fault diagnosis field, the fault feature signal is weak and contaminated by the noise. The lock-in amplifier is a useful tool for weak signal detection. Aiming to the amplitude error of the lock-in amplifier caused by frequency deviation between the measured signal and the reference signal, a DFT-based automatic signal frequency estimation method is studied to improve the frequency accuracy of the reference signal. Based on this frequency estimation method, a software digital lock-in amplifier method is proposed to detect the multiple frequencies signals. This proposed method can automatically measure the frequency value of the measured signal without prior frequency information. Then, the reference signals are generated through this frequency value to make the digital lock-in amplifier estimate the amplitude of the measured signal. Moreover, an iterative structure is used to implement the multiple frequencies signal measurement. The frequencies and amplitudes measurement accuracies are tested. Under different SNR conditions, the frequency relative error is less than 0.1\%. In addition, the amplitude relative error with different signal frequencies is less than 1.7\% when the SNR is -1 dB. This proposed software digital lock-in amplifier method has a higher signal frequency tracking ability and amplitude measurement accuracy.},
